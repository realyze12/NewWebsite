                Hello, I’m Raghav Pant, and I’m the coding and math tutor for JSRP Tutors.

                I’m a recent graduate from the University of California, San Diego having majored in Data Science. I’ve been tutoring coding for 9 years now, ever since I was in 7th grade, and I’ve been learning coding for even longer, ever since I was in 4th grade. <br /><br />
                I tutor a myriad of languages, including Python, Scratch, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                In addition to my degree, my qualifications include a CompTIA ITF+ certification. I am also currently studying for my AWS certification.
                I’ve also created two apps, one of which is on the market, and have created many websites for the OCIW Community. In addition, completed internships with a variety of companies. I am currently interning for Sony Playstation as a Data Engineer. <br /><br/>

                In my classes, younger students, from grades 3 to 4, will be learning block-based coding like Scratch, while older students, grades 5 and up, will learn Python and other text-based coding languages. Apart from these basics, children will also learn many more fundamentals of programming. I will share with the students the tips that made coding easier and more enjoyable for me. I can also relate to them as a tutor who understands their requirements and mindset because of my experience. <br/><br/>

                I also bank upon my experience as an ACT Science tutor with BrightKids QC to make my lessons effective. I have many students who, just like me when I was their age, enjoy taking up the challenge. An introduction to coding at this young of an age can help the child when it comes to choosing a career path. <br /><br />

                I use what I teach nearly every day. Python is a language integral to Data Science and Scratch is a language that serves as a great intro to coding for younger students. In addition, HTML helps me contribute to the surrounding community. <br /> <br/>



                Learning coding is an amazing experience, and I hope that I can help guide your children on the magical journey that is computer science.
