                    My name is Devia Pant, I am an English Language tutor at JSRP Tutors. <br/> <br />
                    I can help your child to unleash their true potential as an English Language learner since that's the objective the
                        classes are geared to achieve. Some of our students have won poetry and creative writing contests and a distinguished
                        set amongst them have been selected as authors slated to publish their work. <br/> <br />

                    A general overview of our English Language classes: <br/> <br/>

                    As a tutor, I have more than twelve years of experience as an English tutor and in the course
                    of more than a decade I have taught students, in person locally in Irvine and also across the US and other
                    countries via Skype. I also work in collaboration with an online company called Bright Kids LLC as an
                    English language SAT, ACT Principal Tutor.  <br /> <br />

                    Having worked with various age groups and grades, my experience as a tutor has helped me design and offer affordable
                        structured lessons which are targeted for maximum enhancement.  <br /> <br />



                    The English lessons are centered around essay writing, reading comprehension, creative writing, grammar,
                        spelling, vocabulary and conversation. <br /> <br />





                    Easy to follow instructions and homework patterned on effective reinforcement creates guaranteed retention. <br /> <br/>

                    Creative writing, academic writing, reading comprehension and effective communication in general is the main focus of my classes. <br /><br />

                    Today the students have to use their writing skills for penning the answers to in depth reading comprehension questions as well.
                        My classes are writing and conversation centric and I ensure that the students learn and apply various strategies to make
                        them adept at these essential skills. <br/> <br/>



                    Most of the students register an impact almost instantly and once their self confidence is fortified, progress is guaranteed. <br /> <br />


                    Our approach is interactive and customized to suit the various learning styles, unlike the one-size-fits-all policy mandated by others in the business.
                        We are proud and at the same time humbled by the testimonials we have earned, from IUSD parents and parents worldwide. <br/><br/>


                    I have taught many other students in CA and am aware of the high standards they need to adhere to.
                        Please let me know if I could schedule a demo class for your child. <br/><br/>



                    Please feel free to call me at 508-615-2631/309 797-2269. <br/><br/>

                    Thanks!
